item-based collaborative filtering (cosine similarity

Approach :

First we looked into content-based recommendation. The dataset did not contain the synopsis of the books to use content-based recommendation and hence moved on to collaborative based recommendations.
We worked with a sample of the dataset for item and user based collaborative filtering using Cosine similarity and correlation were used to find similarity between items/users.
